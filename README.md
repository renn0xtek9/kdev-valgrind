# kdev-valgrind
kdev-valgrind is a plugin offering a full integration of the valgrind suite to KDevelop.


kdev-valgrind is a plugin to KDEVELOP that has
0 unit test
1) No link to any bug tracking system? aka. (where should I file a bug)
2) No link to any mailing list ?!
3) For which it is not possible to open a problem on githbu 
4) That has a bug leading to call /usr/bin/plasmoidviewer every time you start the valgrind memcheck

This bug has been reported on the KDE mailing list one year ago apparently no one listen. Hence this attempt to (try to) communicate with developers who (apparently) don't want any feedback..

If the project is not dead, anyone of good will reading this might at least want to fix point 3. So that we can keep track of problems

Best regards
